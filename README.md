# Alien-Invasion

Howdy, 

This is a cheaply made knock off of Space Invader, if it even deserves to be called that as of now. As the cheap knock of it is, the name resembles the original yet is not the same. There is still a lot of features I would like to add to it such as:
  * A menu
  * High score board that saves
  * Full rezisability of the window and scaling all of attributes displayed
  * Tutorial
  * Different Enemies each worth different amount of points
  * Random live drops
  * Random apperance of special enemies
  * Handmade pixel art sprites, well technically computer made
And I think that is it at least for now. Also probably one or two features I find while working with pygames. Maybe then it will be worth of calling rip-off.

You may be wordering why is it a cheap knock off, well the answer to that is easy. It is because I did not spend a single cent to make it, but most important of it all I did not spend that much time making it due to my laziness. So it is cheap time wise, because money wise it will always be and that is something I can not fix.

Bye, now.
